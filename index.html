    <p>These two dogs were my bestfriends for many years. I found them at the ARF animal rescue.</p>
<ol>
    <li>They loved going for car rides</li>
    <li>one time they ate all the Christmas presents while we were away.</li>
<li>They liked to sit on the sofa and watch movies.</li>


    <!-- add a p tag with two sentences about your pet -->

      <!-- li tag 1 -->
      <!-- li tag 2 -->
      <!-- li tag 3 -->
    <!-- close the ol tag -->
